  <p>A scientist is someone who conducts scientific research to advance knowledge in an area of interest.
    In classical antiquity, there was no real ancient analog of a modern scientist. Instead, philosophers engaged in the philosophical study of nature
    called natural philosophy, a precursor of natural science. It was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after
    it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833.</p>
